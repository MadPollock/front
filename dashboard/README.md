  This is a code bundle for Dashboard Application Shell. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/HVYWrFxaeaoLrc82PhiIgz/Dashboard-Application-Shell.

  ## Running the code

  Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

  ## Previewing with mock authentication

  Set `VITE_ENABLE_MOCK_AUTH=true` in your environment to bypass Auth0 and use a local preview user. This is useful for closed previews where Auth0 credentials are not available and will not affect production builds.
